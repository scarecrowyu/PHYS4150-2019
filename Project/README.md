# Project

The requirement and topics offered by Prof Jian Wang has been uploaded in this folder. The suggested programming language is MATLAB, you could also use python if you want. You are requested to submit your codes as well as report and slides before the due date.

I will run and check the submitted codes. Please remember you should implement the algorithms on your own, so do not just import or call the powerful toolbox/package. 

`Yu_Ziyang.pdf` is a sample of my project report for last year.
